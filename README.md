# CMIP Rapid Evaluation Framework


<!--- --8<-- [start:description] -->

**Status**: This project is in active development. We expect to be ready for beta releases in Q2 2025.

The CMIP Rapid Evaluation Framework is a Python application that provides the ability to rapidly process and
evaluate CMIP data against a set of reference data.
It is designed to be used as a CI/CD pipeline to provide a quick validation of CMIP data.

CMIP REF is a community project, and we welcome contributions from anyone.

## Getting started

### As a metrics provider

Metrics providers are the core of the REF.
They define the metrics that will be calculated and the data that will be used to calculate them,
by providing a consistent interface for the REF to interact with.

These metrics providers can be run as standalone applications or as part of the REF.

### As a modelling center

The REF is designed to enable Modelling Centers to quickly evaluate their data against a set of reference data.
The data under test here may not be published to ESGF yet,
but the REF can still be used to evaluate it.

TODO: Docs for that workflow

```bash
ref datasets ingest {data_path} --solve
```

### As a devops engineer

The REF can also be deployed as a standalone set of services that don't require any user interaction.
This is useful for running the REF to automatically evaluate data as it is published to ESGF.

TODO: Docs for that workflow

Each service in the REF is designed to be run as a separate docker container.

Full documentation can be found at:
[cmip-ref.readthedocs.io](https://cmip-ref.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
We recommend reading the docs there because the internal documentation links
don't render correctly on GitHub's viewer.

## Installation

<!--- --8<-- [start:description] -->

CMIP Rapid Evaluation Framework can be installed with pip, mamba or conda:

The following commands don't work yet, but will be updated when we have a release.

```bash
pip install cmip_ref
mamba install -c conda-forge cmip_ref
conda install -c conda-forge cmip_ref
```
