# # Dataset Selection
# A metric defines the requirements for the data it needs to run.
# The requirements are defined in the `data_requirements` attribute of the metric class.
#
# This notebook provides some examples querying and filtering datasets.

# Each source dataset type has a corresponding adapter that can be used to load the data catalog.

# The adapter provides a consistent interface for ingesting
# and querying datasets across different dataset types.
# It contains information such as the columns that are expected.

# ## Data Catalog
# Below is an example of a data catalog of the CMIP6 datasets that have already been ingested.
#
# This data catalog contains information about the datasets that are available for use in the metrics.
# The data catalog is a pandas DataFrame that contains information about the datasets,
# such as the variable, source_id, and other metadata.
#
# Each row represents an individual NetCDF file,
# with the rows containing the metadata associated with that file.
# There are ~36 different **facets** of metadata for a CMIP6 data file.
# Each of these facets can be used to refine the datasets that are needed for a given metric execution.

# %% [markdown]
# A dataset may consist of more than one file. In the case of CMIP6 datasets,
# the modelling centers who produce the data may chunk a dataset along the time axis.
# The size of these chunks is at the descression of the modelling center.
#
# Datasets share a common set of metadata (see `adapter.dataset_specific_metadata`)
# which do not vary for a given dataset,
# while some facets vary by dataset (`adapter.file_specific_metadata`).
#
# Each data catalog will have a facet that can be used to split the catalog into unique datasets
# (See `adapter.slug_column`).

# ## Data Requirements
# Each metric may be run multiple times with different groups of datasets.
#
# Determining which metric executions should be performed is a three-step process:
# 1. Filter the data catalog based on the metric's requirements
# 2. Group the filtered data catalog using unique metadata fields
# 3. Apply constraints to the groups to ensure the correct data is available
#
# Each group that passes the constraints is a valid group for the metric to be executed.
#
# [cmip_ref.solver.extract_covered_datasets](/api/cmip_ref/solver/#cmip_ref.solver.extract_covered_datasets)
# extracts the different groups
# of datasets within the data catalog that that match the requirements.
# Below are some examples showing different data requests
# and the corresponding groups of datasets that would be executed.

# %% [markdown]

# ### Facet filters
# The simplest data request is a `FacetFilter`.
# This filters the data catalog to include only the data required for a given metric run.

# %%
data_requirement = DataRequirement(
    source_type=SourceDatasetType.CMIP6,

    ),
    group_by=None,
)

groups = extract_covered_datasets(data_catalog, data_requirement)

display_groups(groups)

# %% [markdown]

# ### Group by
# The `group_by` field can be used to split the filtered data into multiple groups,
# each of which has a unique set of values in the specified facets.
# This results in multiple groups of datasets, each of which would correspond to a metric execution.

# %%
data_requirement = DataRequirement(
    source_type=SourceDatasetType.CMIP6,
    filters=(
        # Only include "tas" and "rsut"

        "source_id",
    ),
)

groups = extract_covered_datasets(data_catalog, data_requirement)

display_groups(groups)


# %% [markdown]

# ### Constraints
# A data requirement can optionally specify `Constraint`s.
# These constraints are applied to each group independently to modify a group or ignore it.
# All constraints much hold for a group to be executed.
#
# One type of constraint is a `GroupOperation`.
# This constraint allows for the manipulation of a given group.
# This can be used to remove datasets or include additional datasets from the catalog,
# which is useful into select common datasets for all groups (e.g. cell areas).
#
# Below an `IncludeTas` GroupOperation is included which adds the corresponding `tas` dataset to each group.


# %%

        # we will probably need to include some helpers

            (data_catalog["variable_id"] == "tas")
            & data_catalog["source_id"].isin(group["source_id"].unique())

# %% [markdown]
# In addition to operations, a `GroupValidator` constraint can be specified.
# This validator is used to determine if a group is valid or not.
# If the validator does not return True, then the group is excluded from the list of groups for execution.

    def validate(self, group: pd.DataFrame) -> bool:
